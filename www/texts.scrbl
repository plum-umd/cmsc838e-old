@link["https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/index.html"]{How
to Design Programs, Second Edition (On-line Draft)} by Felleisen,
Findler, Flatt, Krishnamurthi.

If you have never seen functional programming, particularly
type-driven design in functional programming, you should read this
book.

This text uses the Racket environment and Racket-like programming
languages so it can also serve as a good introduction to the
programming language we will be using throughout this course, even
if you are familiar with the concepts the book covers.

@link["https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/"]{Computer Systems: A Programmer's
Perspective, Third Edition} by Bryant and O'Hallaron.

This book gives an excellent overview of computer systems from a
programmer's perspective.  Chapter 3 "Machine-Level Representations of
Programs" is particularly relevant, giving a (for our purposes)
comprehensive description of the x86-64 architecture we target in this
course.}

@link["https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs033/docs/guides/x64_cheatsheet.pdf"]{x64 Cheat Sheet}
Introduction to Computer Systems, Brown University, Tom Doeppner.

These lecture notes provide a quick overview of the x64 assembly language.
Sections 1-3 will be the most relevant to our class. Section 4 has more to do
with C-style data structures and the C calling convention.  It is important to
note that whenever this document refers to a function or function call, it is
referring to a @emph{C-style} function or function call.

@link["http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf"]{An
Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction}, Scheme Workshop 2006,
Abdulaziz Ghuloum.

This paper is the inspiration behind the design of this course.  It
describes the "incremental" approach we adopt where we study compilers
by starting with a complete compiler for a very small language and
incrementally grow it into a compiler for a powerful high-level
language.  If you would like to read a capsule summary of the course
concepts, this is the paper for you.
