Find two programming languages that are new to you, and answer the
following questions.  You should exclude the following languages from
your search: C, C$++$, C\#, Java, Javascript, FORTRAN, LISP, OCaml,
Pascal, Perl, Python, Racket, Ruby, Scheme, SML, Visual Basic.

\section{Language 1:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item When was the language first introduced, approximately, and who developed it initially?

\vspace*{5em}

\item Why was the language created? What community was the language aimed at? What is unique, interesting, and novel about the language?

  \vspace*{5em}

  \item Show and describe a fragment of code (in the language) that you think is particularly interesting, and describe what it does and why it is interesting. You don’t necessarily need to install the language yourself and write your own code from scratch; examples from language documentation are fine.

  \vspace*{30em}
    
  \item Is the language still used today (as far as you can tell) for anything?
